PREDICTIVE MODELING<br><br>
Predictive Modeling is a process to predict outcomes form the data models.<br>
Predictive Modeling is also referred as Predictive Analytics.<br>
Once the data is collected from different sources, models are applied on the trained data so that predictive modeling can forecast the outcomes based ont he questions arised to solve business needs.<br>
It can never predict the future, but it can look at existing data and determine a likely outcome <br>
Predictive Model can be of two categories: Parametric and Non-Parametric,Parametric models make more assumptions and more specific assumptions about the characteristics of the population used in creating the model.<br>
Some of the different types of predictive models are:
## Ordinary Least Squares <br>
## Generalized Linear Models (GLM) <br>
## Logistic Regression <br>
## Random Forests <br>
## Decision Trees <br>
## Neural Networks <br>
## Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) <br>

Here I am using Random Forest Algorithm for data modeling using predictive analytic in python. <br>

# Random Forest 
RF is a combinaiton algorithm proposed where if the predicted result is a discrete value, it is a *random forest classification*, and if it is a continuous value, it is a *random forest regression*. Many empirical studies have confirmed the theory that the random forest algorithm has a high prediction accuracy with good tolerance for abnormal value and noise.<br>
RF algorithm extracts subsamples from the original samples using the bootstrap resampling method and creates decision trees for each sample.<br>
Second, the algorithm classifies the decision trees and implements a simple vote, with the largest vote of the classification as the final result of the prediction.<br>
